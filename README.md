# Lab7Part1
Adding my name to README
Hello, my name is Kyler Kromer and I am a Junior here at the University of Kentucky studying Biosystems Engineering that enjoys going to sporting events. I think the most important is Git because it aallows us to collaborate with each other and see different code that needs to be edited and prgrammed. In the end, this is an introduction to lab7.
